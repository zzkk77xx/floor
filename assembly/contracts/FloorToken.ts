/**
 * @title Floor Token
 * @author Trader Joe
 * @notice The Floor Token contract is made to be inherited by an ERC20-compatible contract.
 * It allows to create a floor for the token, which guarantees that the price of the token will never go below
 * the floor price. On every transfer, the floor will be rebalanced if needed, that is if the amount of token Y
 * available in the pair contract allows to raise the floor by at least one bin.
 * WARNING: The floor mechanism only works if the tokens that are minted are only minted and added as liquidity
 * to the pair contract. If the tokens are minted and sent to an account, the floor mechanism will not work.
 * The order of the tokens should never be changed.
